  threejs_url: image_url, # "threejs" because it needs to match the name of the Stimulus controller. image_url has been defined above.
  images_id: photo.id
  #loading image onto the scene (did deanin also added through form!? YES - 8:24 video)
  # image: photo.image
  # image: image
  # images: @photos.map { |photo| rails_blob_url(photo.image) } # 🍓 this works! WHY? because we're using ActiveStorage, which is a Rails library that allows us to attach files to Active Record objects. It also provides a helper method called rails_blob_url that returns a URL for a given blob. We can use this method to get the URL for each photo's image.
