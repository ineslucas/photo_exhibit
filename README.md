This project is a dynamic 3D visualization where users can upload their photography work. The main focus is on the interactive and dynamic nature of the 3D scene, with user-uploaded images being a key feature.

I've always wanted a place on the inter-webs to showcase my photography. This is that.

**Demo**
http://www.memorylab.space

**Stack**
Using WebGL/Three.JS, esbuild, jsbundling-rails, Active Storage, Yarn to add package managers and Bootstrap.

**How to fork**
Start your server with ./bin/dev.

**Learning outcomes from this project:**
- Full Stack Development in Rails
- Three JS inside Stimulus JS controller
- JavaScript in Rails - passing values and data from database to view to Stimulus and back
- Trigonometry
- Image processing in development
- Deploying with Heroku
- Loading techniques for good performance
- Matter JS inside Stimulus JS controller
- Form Helper styling

This project was about getting as much interactivity out of Rails as possible.
